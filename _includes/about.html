                    <p> My name is Tim and I am a web developer. Currently I am working on a project with a startup part time, building a web application, database and website. In addition to this project, I am currently seeking a fulltime position on a development team, but will consider a contract position. My experience covers a breadth of fields and I have worked on a wide variety of teams. I truly enjoy working with a motivated and talented group of people to accomplish our goals, while helping each other learn and grow our individual skills. <br> I have a Bachelor's degree in both Political Science and Economics. With this background, I have recognized the need for more collaboration and cooperation in the international economy. As a Web Developer I hope to help bridge the gaps through solving common problems faced around the globe. When I am not spending my day with my nose pressed into my computer screen, I am out enjoying the sunshine of San Diego with my girlfriend and exploring the copious amount of eateries and breweries that litter the landscape.</p>
