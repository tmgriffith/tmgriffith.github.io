                    <p>Currently I am working part time on a project with a startup currently named SmartGarden, building a web application to interface with an IoT device and database. In addition I am working with our team on building our promotional website. I am currently seeking new opportunities to apply my skills, In addition to my current responsibilities. My experience covers a breadth of fields and I have worked on a wide variety of teams. I truly enjoy working with a motivated and talented group of people to accomplish our goals, while helping each other learn and grow our individual skills.<br>I have 2 Bachelor's degrees in Political Science and Economics. With this background, I have recognized the need for more collaboration and cooperation in the international economy. As a Web Developer I hope to help bridge the gaps through solving common problems faced around the globe. When I am not spending my day with my nose pressed into my computer screen, I am out enjoying the sunshine of San Diego with my girlfriend and exploring the plethora of eateries and breweries that litter the landscape.</p>
