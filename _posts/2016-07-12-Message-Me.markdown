description: This app was my first attempt at using the powerful Meteor.js platform. It is still a work in progress, and right now all that one can do is log in and create a message thread, then add users to the thread, and allow other users to accept invites to participate in the conversation. The style was created with simple LESS files and the LESS compiler built for the Meteor platform. Also uses Bootstrap 4.0alpha. The frontend was built using Angular 1.5 and in the future it will be converted over to Angular 2.0. The app maintains connection with a web socket and updates the client and the server simultaneously, displaying some of the fastest response times achievable. Unfortunately the Meteor.js team took down their free hosting platform and there is little available at the moment for me to be able to display a working version on the internet currently. However, all of the source code is currently housed on my Github account<strong> <a href="https://github.com/tmgriffith/message-me-app">here</a></strong>. If you would like to see it in action you will need to clone it and then run it from the command line. Just run "meteor npm install" first, then "meteor" in the command prompt and off it will go&#42;.<br><small>&#42;You will need to be sure meteor is already installed before running these scripts in your command line. <a href="https://www.meteor.com/install">Click Here</a> for install instructions</small>
