description: This was a redesign project I did while freelancing. Check it out <a href="http://nine10photo.com/">HERE</a>. <br>My goal for this project was to ensure the site was mobile friendly while modernizing the layout and feel. I had to write some PHP to reorganize the theme template and used copious amounts of CSS to get the layout to be more user friendly, while maintaining a modern feel.<br> The template gave all pages a weird black border, and there was two different footers. A plugin loaded two versions of jQuery and displayed a waring message on Chrome when trying to login. These were some of the problems that I worked to resolve to ensure a seemless user experience.
