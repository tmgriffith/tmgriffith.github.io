description: This was a company website for a project I am involved in currently. It follows a single page design and is integrated with MailChimp for the forms. It has google analytics integrated as well. In building this site I decided to get more familiar with Sass for pre-compiling the CSS and being able to quickly change design features. <a href="http://www.soundseed.co">Check out the full site here</a>.
