description: My portfolio webpage uses a self-customized template from <a href=http://startbootstrap.com/>startbootstrap.com</a> called <a href=http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/>The Freelancer</a>. It contains some custom logic and CSS styles. It is still a work in progress and is my primary focus as a side project. So far in my experience I have focused heavily on backend logic and making things work, however, this site allows me to tinker around with frontend frameworks like Bootstrap and get more familiar with design. All of the images are custom made in illustrator. They are all fairly basic, as I like a more minimalist approach to design. In the near future I will be posting some design work I have done on my current project, “Smart Garden”. Thanks for checking my portfolio out, the image above is from my first version of this portfolio. If you have any suggestions or would like to contact me about any design/programming projects you would like to employ my services for, please <a href=https://tmgriffith.github.io/#contact>send me a message!</a>
