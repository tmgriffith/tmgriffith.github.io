description: This project was built in ASP.net MVC6. It showcases my ability to use MVC frameworks, C# and SQL databases. The application requires a Log-in from a user and then will display contact info in the form of a table. The data is populated from a SQL database and is managed using the Entity framework. With the use of Models, I organised the data to be collected and stored, and then in the Contact Controller I gave users who are logged in the privelige to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions on the data. In addition, I configured an alternative log-in using Google authentication through the Oauth-2 pluggin. It is hosted on Microsoft's cloud service Azure. Go ahead and give it a [test](https://contactmanager20160524100127.azurewebsites.net/Contacts).
