description: This project was built in ASP.net MVC6. It showcases my ability to use MVC frameworks, C# and SQL databases. The application requires a user to log in, then will display contact info in the form of a table. The data is populated from a SQL database and is queried using the Entity framework. With the use of models, I organized the data to be collected and stored, and then in the Contact Controller I gave users who are logged in the privilege to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) functions on the data. In addition, is  configured with an alternative log-in using Google authentication through the Oauth-2 plugin. Contact Manager hosted on Microsoft's cloud service Azure. Go ahead and give it a <strong><a href="https://contactmanager20160524100127.azurewebsites.net/Contacts">test</a></strong>.
