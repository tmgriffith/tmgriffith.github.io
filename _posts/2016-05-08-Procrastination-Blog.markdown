description: This is my first <strong><a href="https://procrastinationlabblog.wordpress.com/">WordPress site</a></strong>. It is built with a free account so there is no custum code on it.
 My goal for this site was to build a modern blog using the popular WordPress platform. What I wanted to acheive was
 to build a familiarity with CMS style website tools in the event that when an opportunity to build a custom site on
 the platform was available, I would be able to leverage both my programming skills and a familiarity with WordPress's CMS to be
 successful.
